                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">This week I tried to focus on this quote from the readings. “‘May it never be that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.’  I will never boast about circumcision. I will never boast in my attention to the externals. I will never boast about how many proselytes I may have brought into conformity to Mosaic Law. I will boast only in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Much like the Jews of Peters's time got caught up about circumcision, I think as a church we can often get caught up in appearances instead of what matters. We focus on whether someone is wearing a blue shirt instead of a white shirt, whether someone is wearing their garments or not, whether someone is proudly drinking caffeinated beverages, or whether someone is wearing a cross. This week I wanted to focus on not making these small judgments of other people and focusing more on Christ and the cross. I often find myself thinking judgemental thoughts about other people when it is not pertinent to who they are as a person. This week when I found myself thinking judgementally, I reminded myself of Peters's metaphor with his handwriting and his focus on the cross. It is pretty hard to be judgemental of others when you are thinking of Christ's crucifixion. I also focussed on not being as boastful as I sometimes can be. I love how Peter emphasizes not boasting about anything but Christ’s death and resurrection. I often will be jokingly boastful with my brother but as I stopped doing that this week I noticed we got into fewer arguments and there was less tension between us. As I focussed more on Christ's crucifixion, and less on my own achievements, I came to appreciate the atonement more and Christ’s help in my own life.

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">This week I wanted to focus on gratitude, more specifically on gratitude for His Atonement. I tried to be an overall more grateful person this week as I went about my daily life. I wrote down things that made me especially grateful. We had decently good weather this week. We had enough snow to go sledding on the weekend. All of my friends were able to go to the basketball game. Etc. While most of the things I wrote down were smaller and more inconsequential to my life, being more grateful has put me in a better mood on a daily basis. One thing that kept coming up in the gratitude journal was the ability to call my family multiple times throughout the week. I am so grateful for the privilege to have a phone that connects me to my family that lives states away from me. I want to continue writing things down that I am grateful for as I think it makes me realize how lucky I am and helps me be kinder and more thoughtful towards others. 
                            Throughout this week, I made countless mistakes. Whether I said a small comment that I shouldn’t have or let stress get the best of me with my family, I made mistakes everyday. Without the Atonement and the gift of repentance that Christ gave us, these mistakes would have been crucial in my eternal downfall. Christ's crucifixion allows me to learn and to grow from the mistakes that I make so that I can grow closer and closer to Christ. I thought of the verse in Alma a lot throughout this week, where it states that he would give up everything he has for the Atonement. I hope that as I continue to learn more about Christ’s sacrifice that I too will have this deep sense of gratitude that Alma portrays.

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">This week I wanted to focus on “thinking celestial” and making sure I am not implementing my own ideas into my scriptures study. In my scripture study this week, I was reading John 5 and 6, where the feeding of the 5000 happens and the Bread of Life sermon. An interesting thing I noticed, that I had noticed but not focused on before, is that Christ seems angry when the people are just there for bread. In my head, my natural thought is if you have to feed people to listen to Christ then that’s not bad but instead of imposing my own ideas onto Christ, I allowed the scriptures to speak to me instead.Christ explains that we need to be sustained off more than just food for our physical bodies. This got me thinking how many times I had heard there was going to be no food at institute, relief society activities, or any other church event and immediately decided I was not going. Just as the people had left Christ when he stopped feeding them, I too sometimes choose this action. After the people leave, Christ turns to his disciples and asks them, “Will ye also go away?” I like to imagine that Christ is also asking this to his reader, if Christ does not provide us with incitement to follow Him, will we still choose to pick up our own cross and follow Him. I imagine moments like this in the scriptures were absolutely heartbreaking for Christ and maybe even frustrating. Yet, despite all of His frustrations and the multiple mistakes we make, Christ still chose to die for us on the cross. People were constantly choosing to not follow Christ and Christ still chooses to die for them. As I applied this strategy to my scripture study, I found myself getting more out of the scripture than I have and noticing different things. </p></div>

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">This week I wanted to focus on loving and serving those around me just as Christ loved us. I was lucky enough to visit home this weekend with my brother. Me and my brother are pretty close which is great but also leads to a lot of arguments. Being back at home, together for three days, caused a lot of disagreements and stupid arguments. While I definitely said things I should not have, in the middle of these arguments I would try and remember my goal of loving more deeply. This allowed me to let some arguments go. Even if I was sure I was right, I tried to prioritize peace and let arguments go. Letting these arguments go, allowed me to take time to cool down and realize I was maybe not completely in the right at all times. This led to apologies from both sides and a more peaceful atmosphere. I’m very grateful that through the atonement of Christ, I am able to learn and grow through my mistakes so that one day I can love as much as Christ did when he took Barabbas’s place on the cross and died for us. Throughout the rest of the week, I also tried to be more loving and have grace with those around me. When friends said something I may have taken offense to, I tried to keep more calm and just let it go. I find this strategy very useful when it comes to small things. I am leaving on my mission in May and I am sure I will have companions who I get annoyed with or who bother me. I want to be able to love as Christ did and let things go. I hope I will be able to have grace with others more completely on my mission and think of the grace that Christ has with us on a daily basis and the love it took to take our place on the cross. </p></div>

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">Reading about the details of the cross made me want to act with more humility, sacrifice, and empathy in my own life. I know that I can often have prideful thoughts so this week when I thought sometimes that was prideful, I tried to recognize it and stop. This week, one of my friends was having a really hard time with school and family. We usually get a treat on Wednesday nights and during our conversation I focussed on listening intently and being fully present in our conversation. This allowed me to better empathize with her and help her in the best way I can. As I focussed on empathy this week, I noticed that usually when I had a judgemental thought, if I chose to listen or try to completely understand, I would often have gained more empathy for the person or situation. I want to focus on this in the future. I think especially when it comes to heated topics about certain religious aspects or politics, I can often think pretty judgemental about people who disagree with me. I want to make sure that I am really trying to understand people who disagree with me and empathize with their situation or opinion. This week I also tried to make small sacrifices more daily in my life. Whether that was allowing a friend to borrow something from me, paying for drinks, or going early to help set up chairs at an event, I noticed that these small things can make a difference in the people around me and also allow me to be more fully appreciative of the things that people often do for me. For after church activities, somebody always has to set up chairs and it usually is not me. Somebody always has to unload the dishwasher and it isn’t always me. Doing these smaller acts of service allowed me to see how much other people do for me and more fully appreciate them. </p></div>

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">This week I wanted to focus on forgiveness. A few years ago I got into a pretty bad argument with a friend. We are still friends but I could tell I was holding onto a little bit of anger. Reading about Christ's statements on the cross makes me think that there is no way I should continue to hold onto this anger. This week I decided to let the anger I have for her go and realize that maybe I wasn’t completely in the right. Me and my brother also consistently get into arguments. This week I focused on completely letting disagreements between us go and learning how to better move on and not letting disagreement turn into contention. 
                            This week I also focussed on calling my mom more. Christ cared for his mom up until his death. Sometimes life gets pretty busy and it can be easy to let calls to my parents slip through the cracks. On walks home, instead of listening to music or a podcast, I would call my mom. These calls reminded me how much short conversations can strengthen a relationship. As she shared her daily activities with me and I shared mine, I felt a lot of appreciation for my parents. When I leave on my mission, I know I won't be able to call whenever I please so I want to continue to take advantage of this now and add family phone calls to my daily routine.

This was a harder week school wise, I had a lot of tests and projects due. During the first half of the week I let my goal to be a better disciple not be at the forefront of the brain. I didn’t do my scripture study as much as I should and my prayers were pretty short and repetitive. I allowed other things in my life to take priority, telling myself when I had time I would totally make sure to focus more on my goal. Half way through, I noticed and made a much bigger effort to change this. It's crazy the change that reading your scriptures do! Although this is often talked about as a primary principle it is amazing how often I forget to do it. When I read the scriptures more, I find myself more focussed on following Christ and being a better disciple. Rather than treating scriptures like another thing on a checklist, when I dedicated time to actively study and search for what God wants me to know, I find myself getting so much more out of it. After scripture study, I feel much more centered and focused. Not only spiritually, but also in classes and tests. Just like Simon in the story learns, being a disciple of Christ is not just for the calm, slow moving parts of life. It is for ALL times of life, especially for those when we feel overwhelmed or busy. I know as I continue to put Christ as a priority in my life and choose to actively follow in HIs footsteps, I will become a better disciple, not just this week, but every day.

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">This week, after reading more about Nicodemus, I decided that I wanted to focus on faith as an action. Nicodemus starts out afraid to follow through with the information he has learned from Christ and ends taking a huge action of faith for Christ. This week when I received a prompting or had a good thought, I did not brush them off as I sometimes do but tried to follow through. When I felt like my roommate could use some service, I washed her dishes for her. When my friend was stressed about getting her homework, I bought her a drink. When my brother and I inevitably got mad at each other when we were playing pickleball, I apologized and tried to make it better with him. While most of the promptings I followed this week were pretty small, I feel like they made a difference in my life and hopefully made a small difference in the day of another person. All of the people I know at BYU are members of church, I have yet to meet someone who attends BYU who is not. When I still lived in my hometown, Vancouver, most people there were not members of the church. While they were not super judgy about my choice of religion, I do think I wasn’t as open about my beliefs as I probably should have been. Like Nicodemus, out of fear of what my peers would think, I often would not make my religion a big part of my personality. Going forward, I would like to do better about this. When I am home for the summers or when I am in a situation where the majority of the people are not members of the church, I would like to be able to have the courage and faith that Nicodemus shows at the end of Christ's crucifixion. </p></div>

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">This week I wanted to focus on the idea that I can continuously be growing and learning through Christ. Like Peter, Mary, and Nicodemus, our faith journey is not to be striving for perfection every day but for growth everyday. This week I really tried to read my scriptures more often, setting aside a dedicated time each day and allowing myself time to be open to prompting or thoughts that the scriptures may give. I think this a good habit I would like to incorporate into my scriptures study as sometimes I can move on really quickly from them which doesn’t give me time to process and think about them deeper. By giving myself a little bit of time after studying, I am keeping myself open to the spirit. Moving forward, I want to focus on being patient with growth. Just as Nicodemus, Mary, and Peter, faith has moments of uncertainty and moments of great clarity. By recognizing this, we can allow for grace for ourselves and others. This week I also tried to focus on not repeating mistakes. Just as Christ reminds Peter he is no longer just a fisher of the seas but a fisher of men, I want to make sure that I am also taking the lessons Christ teaches me in stride. I often get the idea that I should be more patient with my siblings, so this week I really tried to focus on not being quick to anger and giving them grace and remembering that they are growing just as I am. As I am more patient with my siblings, they are more patient and kind with me. This reminds me that the way that we treat others often has a ripple effect and if I choose to lead with love others often follow. </p></div>

                        <div class="bg-faded p-5 rounded"><p class="mb-0">This week I focused on sharing the knowledge I learned in this class about the cross and the different way I view the cross with my family. I called my parents and siblings and shared the interesting things I have learned which led into some good conversations. My mom has always worn a cross and had prayer beads which she hangs in her car to remind her each time she drives of Christ. Growing up with my mom, who has a more positive view of the cross than most members, has given me a more positive view too. Through this class I was able to learn more about the cross and implement the teachings I have learned into my life better. I think the readings this week have given more of an understanding into other religious views and how they might view us as a little off. While I currently live in a pretty heavily LDS populated area, for the majority of my life I will probably be surrounded by more non-members than members. I want to make sure that I am withholding judgement when it comes to others beliefs as judgement usually comes from a place of misunderstanding. One of my favorite tv shows is called Ted Lasso. In this show the main character often states, “Be curious, no judgemental.” I think this theme can really apply to learning about different religious practices. Instead of constantly comparing and judging different religions, it can be helpful to just learn and be curious about them. Leading with curiosity can foster healthy interfaith relationships. Faith is deeply personal and may not always be expressed in the same way but we can still all find common ground and common beliefs. I am grateful for the opportunity to grow my faith and have meaningful discussion withs family and learn from those who believe differently than I do. </p></div>
