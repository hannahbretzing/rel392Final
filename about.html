                                <p>I loved this <a href="https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/80-252/the-cross-of-christ" target="_blank">sermon!</a> I thought it was so interesting that the author talks about unseals and what Peter means when he says he is writing in his own hand. I’ve always thought that was an odd thing to say. Of course, Peter would be writing, who else would be? I didn’t know that there would have been a professional scribe writing down what Peter is saying. This gives a lot more meaning to when Peter states that he is writing in his own hand. It means whatever he is about to write, he thought was important enough to come directly through him instead of being dictated by him and then written down by a scribe. Since he was not a professional, his writing would have been much bigger and sloppier than the scribe. It would have been very obvious that Peter himself had written it. I like how the author of this sermon goes on to explain the parable that Peter sees in his writing. He states that there are people who are going to be very concerned with how things look. In Peter's time, these people were those trying to bridge Judaism and Christianity. They wanted to keep the law of Moses, the fence laws, and also try to learn from Christ's teachings. These people wanted to follow all their old traditions to keep up appearances and avoid taking a stand. By writing these words himself and not having a scribe write it for him, he is stating that he doesn’t care about appearances. He doesn’t care how it looks. Unlike the people unwilling to take a stand for Christianity to keep with appearances and avoid being persecuted, Peter does not care how others may view him. He is ok with his sloppy handwriting because he knows it is not the appearance of things that matter but intent. Peter goes on to say, “May it never be that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.” I love this quote! This quote shows what is important to Peter. While others may boast about bringing people into Judaism, appearances, or other things, Peter will only boast about the cross of Christ. I think this is something I could do better at. Focusing less on appearance and more on Christ and the cross.  </p>

                                </h2>
                                <p>This week we read a lot of scriptures verses in restoration scripture that emphasize the crucifixion. I especially loved reading 1 Nephi 11:14-33. Nephi describes seeing Christ's life, calling Christ the Lamb of God and the Love of God. I like how Nephi goes through Christ's life from birth to His good works and ends with His death, comparing this to how it relates to his fathers dream of the Tree of Life. Christ is the way to eternal life! I also loved Alma 22:15 where he states that Christ is the only true way to eternal life. He states, “Behold, said he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.” I love how he states that he is willing to give up everything he has for atonement. I want to be able to look at the atonement with more gratitude like he does. He talks about Christ's atonement in a way where you know how much it means to him. I want to be able to express my gratitude for the atonement like this. I think as one gains more understanding of the atonement and Christ's crucifixion, one gains more appreciation and gratitude. I want to express this gratitude for Christ, his crucifixion and the blessings they allow me. Overall all of the verses we read for class 8, are filled with gratitude and love for Christ's sacrifice on calvary for us. The final reading I want to mention are the verses 3 Nephi 27 13-21. In these verses, Christ tells the people of the weight of HIs sacrifice and how it allows us to stand before God on Judgement day free of sin. Christ gave us the opportunity to stand before God clean, don’t waste His sacrifice!

                                <p>One thing I loved from the readings this week was the original meaning of the word “gospel’” which is “good tiding” or “good news.” I love how this emphasizes that the gospel is good news! The gospel allows us to see that we all have multiple opportunities through Christ's atonement to learn and grow and live in paradise with God. We should be viewing the gospel as meaning good news! We also dived in the trial of Christ this week. One of my favorite parts of Christ's trial is when Pialte asks if the people want to release Barabbas, a killer and revolutionary, or Christ, the only perfect person. I find it interesting that the people continually yell to free Barabbas instead of Jesus as it can represent who they thought the Messiah would be. Barabbas was a revolutionary against the Romans and had fought for the freedom of the Jews. Many wanted Christ to be like this, a warrior who fought for the temporary freedom of the Jews from the Romans. Instead, they got Jesus, who fought for the permanent freedom of everyone against death and who looked to change and heal the individual. I think we can often expect Christ to be one way only to look at the scriptures and realize He is not. It can be easy to let the outside world affect our view of Christ, His teachings, and His sacrifice. I think it is so interesting that Christ, the son of God, is with the Chief priests and the leaders of Jerusalem and yet they just cannot see who Christ is. They valued other things over Christ, money or status,  and let it blind them to who was in front of them. How often do we let material things come into our relationship with Christ? I know that I probably allow this to happen more than it should. </p>

                                <p>I absolutely loved the video that we watched for the pre-class readings about Barabbas. I have never focussed on Barabbas so much and didn’t release how much symbolism there is with him. Barabbas is never stated in the scriptures as turning to thank Christ. He is set free and then is never heard of again. Barabbas is a killer, a sinner, a man who traditionally would deserve the death on the cross. Christ literally takes Barabbas’s place in death. While Barabbas is still a sinner, Christ takes the cross destined for him. I love this interpretation! There have been many times in my life where I do something wrong, repent and tell Christ I will never do something like that again, only to repeat the same action the next day. Christ knows we are all sinners and will make the same mistakes multiple times. Christ knows this about us, He knows we are sinners who will not show gratitude, and yet He chose to die for us.One quote from this video that especially stood out to me was, “For Jesus knew that the Father would have to treat Jesus like Barabbas so He could treat Barabbas like Jesus.” I think this quote emphasizes how much love is in the atonement. Christ allows himself to be treated like a killer, a sinner, and the worst type of criminal all so that we could be treated like we were perfected. When stated this way I found myself seeing so much more love in the atonement.This also points out to me just how much Christ and God love symbolism. There is so much symbolism in every part of the scriptures, in all the little details. We just have to read close enough to see. </p>

                                <p>This we focussed on what crucifixion would have actually looked like back then. This was interesting because the only source I had before for what crucifixion would have looked like is paintings and those are not always the most accurate. I didn’t know that the feet were nailed on either side of the cross. I can’t even imagine how painful this must have been. I also didn’t know that sometimes the Romans would be a seat on the crosses, not to make it more pleasant for the victim but to make their suffering last longer. Another thing I learned was that many were crucified naked, to further humiliate the victim. Reading about the specifics of crucifixion highlights how much pain was involved. How the victims scourged back would have rubbed against the wood. How the nails likely went into the wrists of the victim where many nerves and veins are. How the Romans made sure every part of the crucifixion process was to heighten the pain of the victims. Making it even worse, crucifixions usually happened on heavily traveled roads which allowed for many people to see the victims. I imagine because of this, Christ would have been aware of the pain that crucifixion holds. This sheds some light on the dread Christ felt in the garden of Gethsemane. He would have seen many crucifixions due to his travel back and forth from Galilee to Judea and known each time he sees a cross that crucifixion was his fate. I imagine the pain was probably intensified as he was dying for the sins of the world. On top of the pain, the event would have been humiliating. Christ's mother, maybe a few disciples (although none are specifically named), and the women he travelled with were at the cross. He would have had some of the people who were closest to him, watching this excruciatingly painful death happen. </p>

                                <p>I think when somebody is the most emotionally distressed that often their true thoughts and feelings come out. When Christ was in his worst hour, when he was suffering the most, on the cross, he didn’t start spouting out insults to the people around him, instead he looked out for his tormentors. One of the statements on the cross that touches me the most is, “Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.” Reading about the specifics of the crucifixion process right before we read the statements from the cross makes me realize how amazing it was that Christ did not get angry on the cross. When I stub my toe, I spew profanity. Christ asks God to forgive the people who have made his death so painful and who had attacked him consistently through his life. This statement really gives us no excuse to not forgive the people around us. If Christ is able to forgive the people who scrouged, mocked, and lifted him up then we should be able to forgive anyway for anything. The other statement from the cross that I really like is, “Woman, here is your son…Here is your mother.” I love that even on the cross, Christ is still looking out for the people around him, especially his mother. He is making sure that his mother is cared for after he dies. I also love the interpretation we talked about in class of how John was invited into the family of Christ through this statement and we too can be brought into the family of Christ through the crucifixion and the atonement. Another statement from the cross that I think is really interesting is, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” I think we have all felt at some point or another that we cannot feel God with us and Christ vocalises this on the cross. </p>

                                <p>Christ is forced to carry part of the cross as he walks towards Golgotha. As Christ stumbles with the unbearable weight of the beam, the soldiers constrict a man named Simon from Cyrene to help him. Luke is the only of the four gospels to specifically mention that Simon carried the cross “behind Jesus..” I like the idea that Luke was referencing something Christ had said earlier in his ministry, “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me” By including Simon, the gospels are showing exactly what discipleship should like, picking up the cross and following in Christ’s footsteps. I like this idea that Simon is the physical portrayal of what a disciple should be. I like how these verses emphasize that one carries their cross while following Christ. Simon from Cyrene was not a disciple because he was walking next to Christ, burden free, but because he endured the burden of the cross while following Christ. I think this goes to show that to be a disciple of Christ often means carrying our metaphorical crosses, our challenges and trials, and throughout them still choosing to follow Christ. Simon becomes closer to Christ through the burden on the cross as we can become closer to Christ through the burden of our trials. Jesus doesn’t say much on the way to Golgotha except to a couple of unnamed women who were crying for him on the road. In Luke 23:28, Christ states to them,"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.” Christ knows that in only a few decades the people of Jerusalem are going to be wiped out by Rome. In Christ's biggest hour of need, He looks outward and feels empathy for those around Him. He is undergoing the biggest trial known to man and still is compassionate with those around Him. </p>

                                <p>I really liked the focus on Nicodemus in the readings this week. I think Nicodemus is such an interesting character in the Bible. I think his character arc is very interesting. He starts out from being too afraid to meet with Christ during the day. When he and Christ meet, Nicodemus asks a lot of questions to which Christ responds but when the conversation is over, Nicodemus doesn’t do anything with the newfound knowledge he has. Instead, he continues living his same life. I think sometimes I can be like this. I get an answer to a prayer or have a prompting, but instead of following it up with action, I just continue with my normal life. When the chief priests are attacking Christ, Nicodemus does stand up for Christ but not enough that he proclaims Christ’s innocence. When Nicodemus brings the 75 pounds of spice for Christ’s burial, this is his first public action for Christ. It's a big one too! 75 pounds of spice would have been a ton of spice and would have made Christ’s burial fit for a king. It’s interesting that only after Christ has died does Nicodemus publicly support Christ. I like how the readings state that it would have been hard for Nicodemus to get these spices on such short notice, meaning that he would have had to either buy them before Christ had died, foreseeing that the Romans would not show mercy or he would have gone through great efforts and even more expense to get these spices for Christ. I also like how the readings compare this moment back to the one pound of myrrh that Mary anoints on Christ's feet. Judas in this moment complains about the waste that this is. This shows the irony as Nicodemus is emerging as a disciple of Christ and spends an extreme amount of money on 75 pounds of spice for Christ. </p>

                                <p>Christ's resurrection is one of my favorite subjects to study. I think it is in human nature to like to hear a victorious story and often the resurrection is what we think of when we think of a victory. I think this class has helped me reshape my thoughts so that I view the crucifixion as also a huge victory for mankind, not just the resurrection. I really liked the focus on the women on the tomb in the readings. Each book emphasizes that Mary Magdalene was at the tomb. I love when we talked about in class that Mary Magdalene has a huge shift throughout the gospels. She starts out with seven devils in her and is transformed through Christ to the first person to see Christ resurrected. I love how the readings and the lecture emphasized that through Christ these are the transformations that can take place in ourselves. I think it's interesting that the story of Mary Magdalene seeing Christ comes right after the story of Nicdoemus bringing spices for Christ’s burial. I think these two characters show the effect that Christ can have. I also really like the focus on John 21 in the readings. This is one of my favorite chapters in the scriptures. I love how there is a tie to the first time Christ meets Peter, James and John and to the last time he does. Both times they are fishing and Christ tells them to fish on the left side. They have been fishing all night so they have obviously tried to fish on the left side, but this time it is Christ who tells them. I also love how Christ makes a special effort to Peter. Peter denied Christ three times before his death so Christ asks Peter three times if he loves him. I always imagined this scene as Christ saying to Peter, “Why are you still here? On this same beach? Doing the same things? Even after you have been through so much with me.” I think this is a really beautiful chapter that shows the individuality of the relationships with Christ and his disciples. </p>

                                <p>This week we focussed on interfaith perspectives on the cross. I thought it was really interesting to see how much other Christen sects value the cross. The Catholic preacher made it very clear how important Christ's death was and how important the cross is. He talked about how he sees the cross as a sign of victory rather than death. Christ uses the cross to overcome death and sin so it should be viewed as a sign of victory. Another person who I really liked hearing from was Brandon Robbins. He mentions how the cross was a way of death that was meant to humiliate and shame the victim. By choosing to wear the cross you are stating that you are willing to humiliate and shame ourselves for the cause of Christ. The cross is a promise to God that we are surrounded by power and authority to those in need and to God. I really liked his take on this. Another person we listened to was a Lutheran pastor. He talks about the crucifix and how many people view it in a negative way when it should not be viewed that way at all. Christ’s death is a central focal point of Christian theology and should be focussed on! While people may want to avoid the crucifixion, we have been baptised into Christ through his death. I really liked hearing about all the different viewpoints on Christ's crucifixion in other Christian denominations. It pointed out to me how different our church is about the crucifixion and the cross and how maybe we need to focus on teaching the cross in a new way. </p>
